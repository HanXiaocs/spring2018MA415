## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r}
data2010 <- read.csv('bp appre 2010.csv')
data2017 <- read.csv('bp appre 2017.csv')
data_summaries <- read.csv('PB monthly summaries.csv')
#lapply(data2010, function(x) x[1])
for (i in c(2:length(data2010))) {
  
    #print(data2010[i])
    barplot(unlist(data2010[i]),names.arg = data2010[1],axisnames =TRUE)
  #print(data2010[i])
  break
  
}
?barplot
#data2010[2]
#read.table()
```
